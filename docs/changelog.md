**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/mithunthomas2003/CRUDFastAPI/compare/v0.12.0...v0.12.1


## [0.12.0] - May 8, 2024

#### Added
- Unpaginated versions of multi-row get methods by @slaarti in #62  ðŸŽ‰
- Nested Join bug fixes
- Dependency handling now working as docs say
- Option to Skip commit in some CRUDFastAPI methods
- Docstring example fixes
- `__in` and `__not_in` filters by @JakNowy ðŸŽ‰
- Fastapi 0.111.0 support

#### Detailed Changes
##### Unpaginated versions of multi-row get methods
Now, if you pass `None` to `limit` in `get_multi` and `get_multi_joined`, you get the whole unpaginated set of data that matches the filters. Use this with caution.

```python
from CRUDFastAPI import CRUDFastAPI
from .models.item import Item
from .database import session as db

crud_items = CRUDFastAPI(Item)
items = await crud_items.get_multi(db=db, limit=None)
# this will return all items in the db
```

##### Dependency handling now working as docs say
Now, you may pass dependencies to `crud_router` or `EndpointCreator` as simple functions instead of needing to wrap them in `fastapi.Depends`.

```python
from .dependencies import get_superuser
app.include_router(
    crud_router(
        session=db,
        model=Item,
        create_schema=ItemCreate,
        update_schema=ItemUpdate,
        delete_schema=ItemDelete,
        create_deps=[get_superuser],
        update_deps=[get_superuser],
        delete_deps=[get_superuser],
        path="/item",
        tags=["item"],
    )
)
```

##### Option to Skip commit in some CRUDFastAPI methods
For `create`, `update`, `db_delete` and `delete` methods of `CRUDFastAPI`, now you have the option of passing `commit=False` so you don't commit the operations immediately.

```python
from CRUDFastAPI import CRUDFastAPI
from .models.item import Item
from .database import session as db

crud_items = CRUDFastAPI(Item)

await crud_items.delete(
    db=db, 
    commit=False, 
    id=1
)
# this will not actually delete until you run a db.commit()
```

##### `__in` and `__not_in` filters
You may now pass `__in` and `__not_in` to methods that accept advanced queries:

- `__gt`: greater than,
- `__lt`: less than,
- `__gte`: greater than or equal to,
- `__lte`: less than or equal to,
- `__ne`: not equal,
- `__in`: included in [tuple, list or set],
- `__not_in`: not included in [tuple, list or set],
- `__startswith`: starts with.

#### What's Changed

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/mithunthomas2003/CRUDFastAPI/compare/v0.11.1...v0.12.0


## [0.11.1] - Apr 22, 2024

#### Added
- `one_or_none` parameter to CRUDFastAPI `get` method (default `False`)
- `nest_joins` parameter to CRUDFastAPI `get_joined` and `get_multi_joined` (default `False`)

#### Detailed Changes
##### `get`
By default, the `get` method in `CRUDFastAPI` returns the `first` object matching all the filters it finds.

If you want to ensure the `one_or_none` behavior, you may pass the parameter as `True`:

```python
crud.get(
    async_session, 
    one_or_none=True, 
    category_id=1
)
```

##### `get_joined` and `get_multi_joined`
By default, `CRUDFastAPI` joins all the data and returns it in a single dictionary.
Let's define two tables:
```python
class User(Base):
    __tablename__ = "user"
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = Column(String)
    tier_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey("tier.id"))


class Tier(Base):
    __tablename__ = "tier"
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = Column(String, unique=True)
```

And join them with `CRUDFastAPI`:

```python
user_tier = await user_crud.get_joined(
    db=db,
    model=Tier,
    join_on=User.tier_id == Tier.id,
    join_type="left",
    join_prefix="tier_",,
    id=1
)
```

We'll get:

```javascript
{
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Example",
    "tier_id": 1,
    "tier_name": "Free",
}
```

Now, if you want the joined data in a nested dictionary instead, you may just pass `nest_joins=True`:

```python
user_tier = await user_crud.get_joined(
    db=db,
    model=Tier,
    join_on=User.tier_id == Tier.id,
    join_type="left",
    join_prefix="tier_",
    nest_joins=True,
    id=1,
)
```

And you will get:

```javascript
{
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Example",
    "tier": {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "Free",
    },
}
```

This works for both `get_joined` and `get_multi_joined`.

!!! WARNING
    Note that the final `"_"` in the passed `"tier_"` is stripped.

#### What's Changed
- Reuse of `select` method in `CRUDFastAPI`
- Skip count call when possible
- Add `one_or_none` parameter to CRUDFastAPI `get` method
- Add `nest_joins` parameter to CRUDFastAPI `get_joined` and `get_multi_joined`

#### New Contributors
- [@JakNowy](https://github.com/JakNowy) made their first contribution in PR #51.

## [0.11.0] - Apr 7, 2024

#### Added
- Multiple primary keys support, a significant enhancement by @dubusster in #31 ðŸŽ‰.
- Option to disable the count in `get_multi` and `get_multi_joined` methods for performance optimization.
- Fixes for a validation bug when `return_as_model` is set to `True`.
- Resolution of a bug concerning incorrect handling of `db_row` in methods.

- Achievement of 100% test coverage, with the addition of a workflow and badge to showcase this milestone.
- Inclusion of the changelog within the project documentation, providing a comprehensive history of changes directly to users.

#### Detailed Changes

##### Multiple Primary Keys Support
CRUDFastAPI now accommodates models with multiple primary keys, facilitating more complex database designs. For models defined with more than one primary key, the endpoint creator automatically generates paths reflecting the primary keys' order. This feature extends support to primary keys named differently than `id`, enhancing the flexibility of CRUDFastAPI's routing capabilities.

###### Example:
For a model with multiple primary keys, CRUDFastAPI generates specific endpoints such as `/multi_pk/get/{id}/{uuid}`, accommodating the unique identification needs of complex data models.

##### Optional Count
The `get_multi` and `get_multi_joined` methods now feature an `return_total_count=False` parameter, allowing users to opt-out of receiving the total count in responses. This option can enhance performance by skipping potentially expensive count operations.

###### Behavior:
- By default, `return_total_count=True` is assumed, returning both data and a total count.
- When set to `False`, responses contain only the data array, omitting the total count for efficiency.

#### What's Changed
- Implementation of multiple primary keys support, addressing a significant flexibility requirement for advanced use cases.
- Introduction of optional count retrieval in multi-get methods, optimizing performance by eliminating unnecessary database queries.
- Several critical bug fixes, improving the stability and reliability of CRUDFastAPI.
- Documentation enhancements, including the addition of a changelog section, ensuring users have access to detailed release information.
- Update to FastAPI `0.111.0`, ensuring compatibility with the latest enhancements in the FastAPI ecosystem.

- Filters for joined models via the `filters` parameter in `JoinConfig`.
- Type checking workflow integrated with `mypy` alongside fixes for typing issues.
- Linting workflow established with `ruff`.

#### Detailed Changes

##### Select
The `select` method constructs a SQL Alchemy `Select` statement, offering flexibility in column selection, filtering, and sorting. It is designed to chain additional SQLAlchemy methods for complex queries.
[Docs here](https://mithunthomas2003.github.io/CRUDFastAPI/usage/crud/#5-select) and [here](https://mithunthomas2003.github.io/CRUDFastAPI/advanced/crud/#the-select-method).

###### Features:
- **Column Selection**: Choose columns via a Pydantic schema.
- **Sorting**: Define columns and their order for sorting.
- **Filtering**: Directly apply filters through keyword arguments.
- **Chaining**: Allow for chaining with other SQLAlchemy methods for advanced query construction.

##### Improved Joins
`JoinConfig` enhances CRUDFastAPI queries by detailing join operations between models, offering configurations like model joining, conditions, prefixes, column selection through schemas, join types, aliases, and direct filtering. [Docs here](https://mithunthomas2003.github.io/CRUDFastAPI/advanced/joins/).

#### Applying Joins in CRUDFastAPI Methods
Detailed explanations and examples are provided for using joins in `count`, `get_joined`, and `get_multi_joined` methods to achieve complex data retrieval, including handling of many-to-many relationships.

#### What's Changed
- New `select` statement functionality added.

## [0.9.1] - Mar 19, 2024

#### Added
- Enhanced `get_joined` and `get_multi_joined` methods to support aliases, enabling multiple joins on the same model. This improvement addresses issue #27.

#### Detailed Changes

##### Alias Support for Complex Joins
With the introduction of alias support, `get_joined` and `get_multi_joined` methods now allow for more complex queries, particularly beneficial in scenarios requiring self-joins or multiple joins on the same table. Aliases help to avoid conflicts and ambiguity by providing unique identifiers for the same model in different join contexts. [Docs here](https://mithunthomas2003.github.io/CRUDFastAPI/advanced/joins/#complex-joins-using-joinconfig).

###### Example: Multiple Joins with Aliases
To demonstrate the use of aliases, consider a task management system where tasks are associated with both an owner and an assigned user from the same `UserModel`. Aliases enable joining the `UserModel` twice under different contexts - as an owner and an assigned user. This example showcases how to set up aliases using the `aliased` function and incorporate them into your `JoinConfig` for clear and conflict-free query construction. [Docs here](https://mithunthomas2003.github.io/CRUDFastAPI/advanced/crud/#example-joining-the-same-model-multiple-times).

#### What's Changed
- Introduction of aliases in joins, improving query flexibility and expressiveness, as detailed by @mithunthomas2003 in PR #29.

## [0.9.0] - Mar 14, 2024

#### Added
- Enhanced `get_joined` and `get_multi_joined` methods now support handling joins with multiple models.

#### Detailed Changes

##### Multi-Model Join Capabilities
The `get_joined` and `get_multi_joined` methods have been upgraded to accommodate joins involving multiple models. This functionality is facilitated through the `joins_config` parameter, allowing for the specification of multiple `JoinConfig` instances. Each instance represents a unique join configuration, broadening the scope for complex data relationship management within CRUDFastAPI. [Docs here](https://mithunthomas2003.github.io/CRUDFastAPI/advanced/joins/).

###### Example: Multi-Model Join
A practical example involves retrieving users alongside their corresponding tier and department details. By configuring `joins_config` with appropriate `JoinConfig` instances for the `Tier` and `Department` models, users can efficiently gather comprehensive data across related models, enhancing data retrieval operations' depth and flexibility.

!!! WARNING
    An error will occur if both single join parameters and `joins_config` are used simultaneously. It's crucial to ensure that your join configurations are correctly set to avoid conflicts.

#### What's Changed
- Introduction of multi-model join support in `get_joined` and `get_multi_joined`, enabling more complex and detailed data retrieval strategies.
- Several minor updates and fixes, including package import corrections and `pyproject.toml` updates, to improve the library's usability and stability.

## [0.8.0] - Mar 4, 2024

#### Added
- Feature to customize names of auto-generated endpoints using the `endpoint_names` parameter, applicable in both `crud_router` function and `EndpointCreator`.

#### Detailed Changes

##### Custom Endpoint Naming
The introduction of the `endpoint_names` parameter offers flexibility in defining endpoint names for CRUD operations. This enhancement caters to the need for more descriptive or project-specific naming conventions, enabling developers to align the API's interface with their domain language or organizational standards. 

###### Example: Customizing Endpoint Names with `crud_router`
Customizing endpoint names is straightforward with the `crud_router` function. By providing a dictionary mapping CRUD operation names to desired endpoint names, developers can easily tailor their API's paths to fit their application's unique requirements.

###### Example: Customizing Endpoint Names with `EndpointCreator`
Similarly, when using the `EndpointCreator`, the `endpoint_names` parameter allows for the same level of customization, ensuring consistency across different parts of the application or service.

!!! TIP

    It's not necessary to specify all endpoint names; only those you wish to change need to be included in the `endpoint_names` dictionary. This flexibility ensures minimal configuration effort for maximum impact.

#### What's Changed
- Enhanced endpoint customization capabilities through `endpoint_names` parameter, supporting a more tailored and intuitive API design.
- Documentation updates to guide users through the process of customizing endpoint names.
